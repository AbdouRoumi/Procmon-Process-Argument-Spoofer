## Overview

Welcome to the `Procmon-Argument-Spoofer` repository! This project focuses on manipulating process arguments to bypass monitoring tools like **Process Monitor (Procmon)**. The goal is to demonstrate how argument spoofing can be used to obscure malicious activities or evade detection during system monitoring.

This repository is for **educational and research purposes only** and aims to help security professionals understand and defend against such techniques.

## Features

This repository includes the following techniques:

- **Argument Spoofing**: Modify process arguments at runtime to evade monitoring.
- **Process Injection**: Demonstrates methods to inject spoofed arguments into a target process.
- **Anti-Detection Mechanisms**: Techniques to reduce traceability during spoofing operations.

## Installation

To set up and run this project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Procmon-Argument-Spoofer.git
   ```

2. **Open in Visual Studio:**
   - Load the solution file into **Visual Studio**.

3. **Build the Solution:**
